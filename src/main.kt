//ata class must have all pros defined in its primary constructor,
// the primary constructor is required not private because
// the generated copy() method will expose its primary constructor.
// Data class canâ€™t hide all its constructors.
//I always treat data class as something that sounds not bad but never works well.
// I suggest you not pay so much attention into data class. If you want a value-base class,
// just write it as how you write with Java.
